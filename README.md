# Shaft-Design-and-Analysis-with-MATLAB
# Shaft Design Project 

This project involves the design and analysis of a shaft using MATLAB. The script (`shaft_design_revize.m`) performs calculations related to shaft diameters, torque distribution, shear forces, and safety factors according to mechanical design principles.

## 📄 **Description :**
The shaft design project is developed as part of an engineering assignment by Yakup Erkan Kaymaz. The MATLAB script allows for:

- User input for shaft diameters

- Calculation of shear forces and moments

- Torque distribution and moment diagrams

- Safety factor analysis based on Goodman criteria

### 🚀 **Technologies Used :**
- **MATLAB** for numerical calculations and visualizations

- **Mechanical Design Principles** for safety and strength analysis

### 📂 **File / Dosya:**
- `shaft_design_revize.m`: The main script for shaft design calculations and plotting.

### ⚙️ **Installation and Usage :**
1. Open MATLAB and navigate to the directory containing `shaft_design_revize.m`.

2. Run the script using the MATLAB command window:
```matlab
shaft_design_revize
```
3. Follow the prompts to input shaft diameters and observe the generated plots for torque, shear force, and moment distributions.

## 📈 **Features:**
- **Dynamic Input :** Allows users to enter shaft dimensions interactively.


- **Visualization :** Automatically generates diagrams for torque, shear forces, and moments.

- **Safety Analysis :** Computes safety factors and checks design limits based on material properties (AISI 1020 CD Alloy).


### 🛠️ **Additional Considerations:**
- Ensure the MATLAB path is set correctly to avoid file not found errors.
- Recommended MATLAB version: R2020a or newer.
